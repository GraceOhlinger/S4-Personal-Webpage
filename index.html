		<h2><center> A Little Bit About Me </center></h2>
				 <hr />
			<p><center> I am currently a student at Millersville University working to get my bachelor's degree. I received my associate's degree in Graphic Communications and Printing Technology through Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology in 2019. I decided to work in the printing industry but discovered that I was no longer interested in printing, but instead graphic design. I hope to work in graphic design or web design when I graduate. </center></p>

			<h2><center> My Work </center></h2>
				<hr />
			<p><center> Since I have no work experience in the graphic design field yet, I thought that I would take the opportunity to put in some of the work that I have designed while in school. This poster series, <i><q>Home Is Where My Heart Is,</q></i> was part of a final project for my Typography I class. Our final project was to create posters for a non-profit organization while putting meaning behind the typography we chose to use. I chose ASPCA because I care about animals and helping them get new homes. I am proud of how this project turned out. These posters helped me understand the meaning of typography more because of this project. This is one of my reasons why I am so interested in graphic design as a possible career because you learn something new every day. </center></p>

			<p><center> For this poster series, I wanted to create the feeling that an animal may feel when it is in a loving home, a feeling that the animal wants to have for the rest of its life. So many animals today live without homes, which is an incredibly sad topic. I felt that if the posters revealed a more positive approach, the audience would want to help with the organization more. If the posters were to have a sad approach, there may be fewer people involved because of the feeling may they feel may have when viewing the poster. </center></p>

		<td><b><q>Home Is Where My Heart Is</q> (Heart)</b>

<p1> I felt that this poster expressed more of the loving side of animals. That they would do anything to be with a family that loves them. I chose a heart to replace the letter <q><i>o</i></q> in the word <q><i>home</i></q> because I felt that this design choice makes the poster more interesting and exciting then just the word <q><i>home</i></q>. Both the heart in the word <q><i>home</i></q>, and the word <q><i>heart</i></q> are the same shade of pink, which symbolizes the importance of a loving home. I learned that for this project, the information about the organization was secondary to the tagline or <q>story</q> that the poster is conveying to the viewer/audience. </p1></td>

<p2> One thing that I appreciate with this poster is the variety it has, specifically with color. While I have a similar approach to this poster as I did with the previous one, I think that they both convey the same message in different ways. For example, I use a paw print instead of a heart. With this difference, I think it explains what the poster is about without looking for a logo whereas the heart doesn't explain everything right away. The word <q><i>heart</i></q> expresses a more gentle and caring approach versus the bold text with the word <q><i>home</i></q> symbolizing the main focus for both posters, which is a forever home for animals that need help. </p2></td>
